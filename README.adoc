= History of containerization slides

Talk proposed to Devoxx France 2022 CFP (conference)

Contains the slides of the talk on *the history of containerization*. +
They can be http://ardemius.github.io/history-of-containerization/slides.html[*viewed online here*], by using the *GitHub pages* of the project.

They were built using http://asciidoctor.org/[*Asciidoctor*], and the backend https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js[*reveal.js*]. +
To know how to generate them, have a look at https://github.com/Ardemius/asciidoctor-presentation#slides-rendering-with-revealjs[this section] of my presentation on those tools.
